=========

Having spotify in one window change to a terminal with Alt + Tab and run

  $ python alarm.py

The macro runs "Alt + Tab" then "Space".

You can specify hours and minutes for the time you want to sleep like

  $ python alarm.py 5 30

This is 5 hours and 30 minuts

Tested in spotify web client in Chrome and should work on any browser or the native client.
